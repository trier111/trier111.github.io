    <p>
      When the skeleton sees your face, it doesn’t just rattle its bones — it
      rattles your patience too. With no skin to hide its judgment and no soul
      to sugarcoat the truth, it simply points a bony finger and says, “Banka,
      go fuck yourself.” Because sometimes, the bare-boned honesty of a skeleton
      is all you need to realize you’ve crossed the line… and it won’t hesitate
      to send you straight to hell with style.
    </p>
    <h2>Why "Go to hell" ?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Because you walked in like you own the place, and the skeleton’s
        patience expired centuries ago.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because your vibes were so cursed even a dead guy felt uncomfortable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because you asked for “just one more favor,” and the skeleton’s soul
        left its body… again.
      </li>
    </ol>
